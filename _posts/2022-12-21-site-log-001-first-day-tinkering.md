## First Day Tinkering

Welcome to Gears of Gordon where I build a static page as a personal blog. I also see Gears of Gordon as being a landing page to get in touch with me and view my projects. I was inspired to build this site by one of my lecturers in my Cloud Technologies program. I will share links to all the guides and tools I've been using at the end of this post.  

Today I installed a variety of tools to create the environment for building this site. I had to install Jekyll, Git, Posh-Git for Powershell, and VSCode. I also used github to create a new repo based on the theme I was after and I cloned that repo from github to work on it from local. Along the way I also got my websites serving on localhost so that I could preview what I had so far which was very helpful. Currently I am writing up this post in Markdown Using VSCode, happily logging my progress on my first day.  

Today I experienced and overcame some challenges. After searching through Jekyll themes it turned out that many of the themes I wanted to try weren't available in a Gem the way my tutorial demonstrated. Reading through the installation guide it became clear that I had to clone it to my hitherto-derilect GitHub account. I did some re-branding using stock images and Canva. I also changed my Username to fit with the rebrand. Once I had my profile presentable I was able to use it to clone the theme I wanted into a new repository.  

Another challenge I had to overcome was refreshing my knowledge of the lingo and commands in Git. I was able to get refreshed with Ray's succinct intro course linked below.

Finally there was the challenge of selecting a theme to build the site with. After several false starts and troubleshooting the different installation methods for different themes I finally settled on Gradfolio on the merits of its features, ease of installation, and style.

The most satisfying event by far has been to preview my site in a browser with my localhost acting as a the server and just clicking around, knowing that everything in there is where I put it.  But I'm also feeling relief from getting through a lot of the first day chaff of a project like this such as making decisions about branding and clicking through Next Next Finish wizards. I feel like the knowledge I've applied in getting this far will continue to snowball. 

My next milestone will be to clean up this repo deleting the demonstration files. Build the site into files that can really be hosted on AWS and write another Log about the experience. Till next time! ~ciao!
