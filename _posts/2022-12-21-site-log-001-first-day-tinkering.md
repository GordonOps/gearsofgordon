##Site Log 001
###First Day Tinkering

Welcome to Gears of Gordon where I build a static page as a Personal Blog and a landing page to get in touch with me and view my projects. I have been inspired to go on this journey by one of my lecturers. Creating and hosting this is partly a portfolio or example of my abilities.  I will share links to all the guides and tools I've been using at the end of this post.  

What I have so far... I installed a variety of tools to create the environment for building this site, including Jekyll, Git, Posh-Git for Powershell, VSCode. I also used github to clone a Jekyll theme and get started. I am writing up this post in Markdown Using VSCode logging my progress on my first day.  

Today I experienced and overcame some challenges. After searching through themes the Theme I wanted wasn't available in a Gem the way my tutorial demonstrated. Reading through the installation guide it became clear that I had to clone it to my till now derilect GitHub account. I did some re-branding using stock images and Canva. I also changed my Username to fit with the rebrand. Once I had my profile presentable I was able to use it to clone the theme I wanted into the repository that will come to store my static site.  

Another challenge I had to overcome was catching up on some of the lingo and commands. I was able to get refreshed on basic git concepts and commands with Ray's succinct intro course.  

The most satisfying event by far has been to preview my site in a browser with my localhost acting as a the server and just clicking around, knowing that everything in there is where I put it.  

My next milestone will be to clean up this repo deleting the demonstration files. Build the site into files that can really be hosted and write another Log about the experience. Till next time ~ciao
