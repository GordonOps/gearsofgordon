Day 2 Happened on Dec 22 including a battery of 6 commits. There were many changes to the content of the site. The Index.md file which generates the site's home page was remade with a custom profile photo, a paragraph indexing the site and a small CV. I also added a formspree.io contact box which emails a mozmail email forwarder. In all this branding and content was fairly rewarding to make. 

Commits were also made for correcting the socials at the bottom of the page. I had used full links in the config which only required account names. I also cleared out all the projects and posts that came with the original site template and input placeholders for my own projects. 

I continued to work with GIT in VSCode and at the end of the day left the work committed on local but not yet pushed to Github
